2. **Book Expenses and Sustainability:**
   - Buying new books is expensive, and the environmental impact of book production is a concern.

3. **Lack of Personalized Recommendations:**
   - Generic book recommendations from algorithms lack a personal touch.

4. **Social Isolation in Reading:**
   - Reading has become a solitary activity, with readers missing out on sharing thoughts and discoveries.

5. **Unused Book Collections:**
   - Readers often have books that are read and then set aside, collecting dust.
